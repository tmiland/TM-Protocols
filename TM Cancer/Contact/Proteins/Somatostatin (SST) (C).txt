Somatostatin-14 Inhibits the secretion of pituitary hormones, including that of growth hormone/somatotropin (GH1), PRL, ACTH, luteinizing hormone (LH) and TSH. 
Also impairs ghrelin- and GnRH-stimulated secretion of GH1 and LH; the inhibition of ghrelin-stimulated secretion of GH1 can be further increased by neuronostatin. 
Neuronostatin May enhance low-glucose-induced glucagon release by pancreatic alpha cells (By similarity). This effect may be mediated by binding to GPR107 and PKA activation (By similarity). 
May regulate cardiac contractile function (By similarity). May compromise cardiomyocyte viability (By similarity). 
In the central nervous system, may impair memory retention and may affect hippocampal excitability (By similarity). 
May also have anxiolytic and anorexigenic effects (By similarity). May play a role in arterial pressure regulation (By similarity). 
May inhibit basal, but not ghrelin- or GnRH-stimulated secretion of GH1 or LH, but does not affect the release of other pituitary hormones, 
including PRL, ACTH, FSH or TSH. Potentiates inhibitory action of somatostatin on ghrelin-stimulated secretion of GH1, but not that on GnRH-stimulated secretion of LH (PubMed:29615476).

1. Introduction and Basic Pharmacology

The cyclic peptide hormone somatostatin (SST) occurs naturally in the body of mammals, primarily in the central nervous system, the pancreas, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [1,2,3,4]. It possesses a wide range of inhibitory functions, including the inhibition of hypothalamic hormones [5,6], the regulation of gastrin and gastric acid secretion [7], the release of insulin, glucagon [8,9], pancreatic amylase [10], and other hormones in the GI tract like cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and secretin [1]. Furthermore, it can exert inhibitory effects on cell proliferation [11,12,13,14]. Even anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptory effects have been described [15]. These properties make somatostatin a potential candidate for therapeutic use in a vast range of diseases. Currently, it is used to treat acromegaly, Cushing’s disease, certain forms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) [15].

Somatostatin was first discovered in 1973 by Brazeau et al. in an ovine hypothalamic extract at the Salk Institute in La Jolla [16,17,18]. At first, only the 14 aa isoform had been found; the existence of a second, larger isoform was discovered in 1980 [19,20]. Somatostatin is encoded by a gene that lies on chromosome 3q28 [21]. Its production entails two steps: A large precursor peptide called preprosomatostatin is cleaved and converted into prosomatostatin, from which, in turn, the two abovementioned active isoforms of somatostatin are produced [22,23]. Their functions strongly overlap, but the shorter one occurs much more frequently while the larger one shows a higher potency [22]. They have a very short half-life of around 3 min, which initially limited their pharmacological use in the treatment of diseases; longer-lasting somatostatin analogues had to be developed; the first one was octreotide [24]. Over the years, many more were added to the therapeutic arsenal, including lanreotide, vapreotide, seglitide, and pasireotide, with half-lives of 1.5 to 2 h [25].

The effect somatostatin has on different cells in different tissues is in part determined by the types of somatostatin receptors expressed on their surface. In 1992, the first two somatostatin receptors were discovered, termed SSTR1 and SSTR2 [26]. Today, 5 SST receptors are known to exist, termed SSTR1 through 5, which are encoded by five different genes, each on a separate chromosome. All are G-protein-coupled receptors [27]. Both isotypes of somatostatin, as well as another endogenous peptide called cortistatin [28], bind to these receptors with similar high affinity, one exception being the even higher affinity of SSTR5 to SST-28 [29,30]. Of these receptors, the SSTR2 is the only one of which there are 2 isoforms, SSTR2a and SSTR2b, produced by alternate splicing [1]. The SSTRs are widely distributed throughout all tissues in the human body, with varying expression profiles of the different receptors. A multitude of intracellular pathways following activation of the receptors have been described. The antisecretory effects are mainly achieved by an inhibition of exocytosis, for example, through altering the levels of second messengers, like cAMP, or by activating ion channels, and thus altering intracellular calcium levels. The antiproliferative effects are achieved by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis through protein tyrosine phosphatases or possibly by inhibiting the release of growth factors [2,15]. The issue is further complicated by the fact that the receptors can form dimers, thereby gaining unique pharmacological properties [22]. There are a number of detailed reviews on somatostatin receptor signaling [1,6,31,32].

There are characteristic receptor profiles of certain tumors—neuroendocrine tumors have repeatedly been shown to express the somatostatin receptors 2 and 5 [15,33,34,35,36], which makes them targets for therapy via certain somatostatin analogues. The intricacies of anti-secretory and antiproliferative usage of SSAs will be discussed in further detail in the following chapters.
