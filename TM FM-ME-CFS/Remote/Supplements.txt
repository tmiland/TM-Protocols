"Program_Description=Punicalagin (Pomegranate extract) - (Remote)
Punicalagin, the main ingredient of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) husk, is a high molecular weight polyphenolic compound. It has shown remarkable pharmacological activities attributed in the presence of dissociable OH groups. To isolate punicalagin, previous methods included labor intensive and expensive solid phase extractions by column chromatography (C-18, polyamides, dellulose, Sephadex Lipophilic LH-20, Diaion HP20). High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) was used for isolation and purification of punicalagin from pomegranate husk. Using preparative HSCCC about a 350 mg amount of the crude extract was separated, yielding 105 mg of punicalagin at a high-purity of over 92%. Eighty milligrams of gallic acid was simultaneously separated as another product, at a purity of 75%.

The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against ltigtMycobacterium tuberculosisltigt (prevents the multiplying of bacteria without destroying them). It also inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid. There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acids bacteriostatic action against ltigtMycobacterium tuberculosisltigt. Firstly aminosalicylic acid inhibits folic acid synthesis (without potentiation with antifolic compounds). The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. As bacteria are unable to use external sources of folic acid cell growth and multiplication slows. Secondly aminosalicylic acid may inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall component mycobactin thus reducing iron uptake by ltigtM. tuberculosisltigt.

Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase activity. Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Constitutively expressed in some tissues in physiological conditions such as the endothelium kidney and brain and in pathological conditions such as in cancer. PTGS2 is responsible for production of inflammatory prostaglandins. Up-regulation of PTGS2 is also associated with increased cell adhesion phenotypic changes resistance to apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis. In cancer cells PTGS2 is a key step in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which plays important roles in modulating motility proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Scaffold protein binding. Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines bacterial or viral products DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response growth control or protection against apoptosis. Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20TNFAIP3 TAX1BP1 and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11). Therefore CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation the MAP3K14-activated CHUKIKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2p100 associated with RelB inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. In turn these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Participates also in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14NIK. Within the nucleus phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities. Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at Ser-10 that are subsequently acetylated at Lys-14 by CREBBP. Additionally phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed15084260). Iron ion binding. Catalyzes the first step in leukotriene biosynthesis and thereby plays a role in inflammatory processes. Phospholipase a2 activity. PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides. Has a preference for arachidonic-containing phospholipids. Coenzyme transport and metabolism. Peroxidase activity. Part of the host defense system of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It is responsible for microbicidal activity against a wide range of organisms. In the stimulated PMN MPO catalyzes the production of hypohalous acids primarily hypochlorous acid in physiologic situations and other toxic intermediates that greatly enhance PMN microbicidal activity.

What is MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)? It’s an organic sulfur-containing compound that’s used to improve immune function, lower inflammation and help restore healthy bodily tissue. The reason so many benefits are attributed to the MSM supplement is because MSM provides biologically active sulfur, which is the fourth most plentiful mineral in the body and needed for many different critical bodily functions every single day.

1. Treats Osteoarthritis and Joint Pain
2. Improves Digestive Problems Like Leaky Gut Syndrome
3. Repairs Skin and Treats Skin Problems Including Rosacea, Allergies, Wounds
4. Lowers Muscle Pain and Muscle Spasms
5. Restores Hair Growth
6. Helps the Body Adapt to Stress

Some of the most common uses for MSM include treating: (11)

    chronic joint pain (osteoarthritis, joint inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis)
    leaky gut syndrome and autoimmune disorders
    osteoporosis and susceptibility to bone fractures
    bursitis, tendonitis, the development of scar tissue and other musculoskeletal pains
    allergies and asthma
    yeast infections
    muscle cramps
    constipation, ulcers, upset stomach, indigestion
    PMS symptoms (cramps, headaches, water retention, indigestion)
    stretch marks
    hair loss
    skin problems including wrinkles, sun burns (it offers some protection against UV light/wind burn), wounds, cuts, skin abrasions
    eye inflammation
    poor circulation

Small molecule binding This protein is quantitatively the main protein synthesized and secreted in the endometrium from mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and during the first semester of pregnancy. Zinc ion binding. Transcription factor. Has a lower transcription activation potential than HNF4-alpha. Lipid binding. Steroid hydroxylase activity. Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds including steroids fatty acids and xenobiotics. In the epoxidation of arachidonic acid it generates only 1415- and 1112-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol). Binds long-chain fatty acids such as palmitate and may play a role in lipid transport or fatty acid metabolism. Photoreceptor activity. Photoreceptor required for image-forming vision at low light intensity. Required for photoreceptor cell viability after birth. Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal triggers a conformational change leading to G-protein activation and release of all-trans retinal. Vitamin e binding. Carrier protein. Binds to some hydrophobic molecules and promotes their transfer between the different cellular sites. Binds with high affinity to alpha-tocopherol. Also binds with a weaker affinity to other tocopherols and to tocotrienols. May have a transcriptional activatory activity via its association with alpha-tocopherol. Probably recognizes and binds some squalene structure suggesting that it may regulate cholesterol biosynthesis by increasing the transfer of squalene to a metabolic active pool in the cell. Palmitoyl-coa hydrolase activity. Removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate from modified cysteine residues in proteins or peptides during lysosomal degradation. Prefers acyl chain lengths of 14 to 18 carbons. Transporter activity. May play a role in lipid transport protein in Schwann cells. May bind cholesterol. Lactose synthase activity. Regulatory subunit of lactose synthase changes the substrate specificity of galactosyltransferase in the mammary gland making glucose a good acceptor substrate for this enzyme. This enables LS to synthesize lactose the major carbohydrate component of milk. In other tissues galactosyltransferase transfers galactose onto the N-acetylglucosamine of the oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins. Lipid transport protein in adipocytes. Binds both long chain fatty acids and retinoic acid. Delivers long-chain fatty acids and retinoic acid to their cognate receptors in the nucleus (By similarity). High specificity for fatty acids. Highest affinity for C18 chain length. Decreasing the chain length or introducing double bonds reduces the affinity. May be involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Oleic acid binding. FABP are thought to play a role in the intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids and their acyl-CoA esters. FABP are thought to play a role in the intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids and their acyl-CoA esters. FABP2 is probably involved in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein synthesis. Binds saturated long-chain fatty acids with a high affinity but binds with a lower affinity to unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. FABP2 may also help maintain energy homeostasis by functioning as a lipid sensor. Toxic substance binding. Serum albumin the main protein of plasma has a good binding capacity for water Ca(2) Na() K() fatty acids hormones bilirubin and drugs. Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. Major zinc transporter in plasma typically binds about 80 of all plasma zinc. Xenobiotic-transporting atpase activity. Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells.

"Program_Description=Alpha-Linolenic Acid
Molecular Weight 278.224580204. Description: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid. It is a component of many common vegetable oils and is important to human nutrition. Wikipedia. liquid Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA) is an 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds. It is also called an omega-3 fatty acid and is essential for all mammals. Alpha-linolenic acid (or omega 3 fatty acid) intake can decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 1) preventing arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death 2) decreasing the risk of thrombosis (blood clot formation) that can lead to heart attack or stroke 3) decreasing serum triglyceride levels 4) slowing the growth of atherosclerotic plaque 5) improving vascular endothelial function 6) lowering blood pressure slightly and 7) decreasing inflammation. ALA deficiencies can lead to visual problems and sensory neuropathy. Scaly and hemorrhagic skin or scalp inflammations may also develop. Alpha Linolenic Acid or ALA is considered an essential fatty acid because it is required for human health but cannot be synthesized by humans. It is in fact a plant-derived fatty acid. Humans can synthesize other omega-3 fatty acids from ALA including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. These eicosanoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. ALA metabolites may also inhibit the production of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Omega-3 fatty acids like ALA and its byproducts can modulate the expression of a number of genes including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. They regulate gene expression through their effects on the activity of transcription factors including NF-kappa B and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. Incorporation of ALA and its metabolites in cell membranes can affect membrane fluidity and may play a role in anti-inflammatory activity inhibition of platelet aggregation and possibly in anti-proliferative actions of ALA. ALA is first metabolized by delta6 desaturease into steridonic acid. Midlothian Laboratories. Trigen Laboratories Inc.

A tetrahydrate is a molecule surrounded by four (4) molecules of water, forming a hydrate. The notation for a tetrahydrate is anhydrous molecule's formula·4H2O, where the 4 represents tetrahydrate, and the H2O represents the tetrahydrate. And the molecule's name changes to anhydrous molecule's name tetrahydrate.
