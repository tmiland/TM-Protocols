During normal development or during disease, animal cells experience hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions, and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors implement most of the critical changes in gene expression that enable animals to adapt to this stress. Here, we examine the roles of HIF-1 in post-mitotic aging. We examined the effects of HIF-1 over-expression and of hif-1 loss-of-function mutations on longevity in C. elegans, a powerful genetic system in which adult somatic cells are post-mitotic. We constructed transgenic lines that expressed varying levels of HIF-1 protein and discovered a positive correlation between HIF-1 expression levels and lifespan. The data further showed that HIF-1 acted in parallel to the SKN-1/NRF and DAF-16/FOXO transcription factors to promote longevity. HIF-1 over-expression also conferred increased resistance to heat and oxidative stress. We isolated and characterized additional hif-1 mutations, and we found that each of 3 loss-of-function mutations conferred increased longevity in normal lab culture conditions, but, unlike HIF-1 over-expression, a hif-1 deletion mutation did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 or skn-1 mutants. We conclude that HIF-1 over-expression and hif-1 loss-of-function mutations promote longevity by different pathways. These data establish HIF-1 as one of the key stress-responsive transcription factors that modulate longevity in C. elegans and advance our understanding of the regulatory networks that link oxygen homeostasis and aging.

Introduction

During development, homeostasis, and disease, cells integrate diverse environmental inputs and implement the appropriate changes in gene expression to survive stresses or execute developmental programs. Of the many environmental challenges that animals encounter, oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) is of particular concern. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration, and is, therefore, necessary for most metazoan life. Successful adaptation to hypoxia involves changes in genetic programs that modulate metabolism, cell death, growth, and cellular differentiation. Many of these processes also have roles in cellular aging. This suggests that the networks that govern oxygen homeostasis and aging may be intertwined, but the molecules and mechanisms that underpin these networks are not fully understood.

In animals as diverse as humans and C. elegans, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) heterodimeric transcription factors are responsible for most of the hypoxia-induced changes in gene expression [1], [2]. HIFs have been studied intensively by the biomedical research community, because HIFs have central roles in cancer and cardiovascular disease. Small molecules that inhibit HIF may be effective chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, for patients in which injury, anemia, or ischemia has decreased oxygen supply to tissues, treatments that increase HIF levels may improve cell survival and stimulate angiogenesis.

HIF regulatory networks are acutely sensitive to oxygen. The HIF transcription complex is heterodimeric, and both subunits belong to the family of DNA-binding transcription factors that contain basic-helix-loop-helix and PAS domains. HIFa stability is regulated by oxygen-dependent degradation. When oxygen levels are sufficiently high, HIFa is hydroxylated by members of the EGL-9/PHD family of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. This modification allows VHL, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, to bind HIFa and target it for proteasomal degradation. In hypoxic conditions, HIFa is stable, and the HIF complex activates a battery of genes that enable adaptation to low oxygen conditions. HIF stability and activity are influenced by reactive oxygen species, citric acid cycle intermediates, Fe(II) availability, and intracellular signaling events [1], [3]. HIFs are, therefore, well-positioned to integrate information about oxygen availability and cellular redox and to effect changes that influence stress resistance.

Here, we test the hypothesis that HIF modulates post-mitotic aging. Previous studies in human cells had demonstrated that HIF promoted telomerase expression [4] and that this contributed to increases in the replicative lifespan of primary human lung fibroblasts in hypoxic conditions [5], but the roles of HIF in post-mitotic aging were not understood. The somatic cells of adult C. elegans are post-mitotic, and the rate of aging can be modulated by genes that control insulin-like receptor signaling, mitochondrial function, protein folding, or responses to reactive oxygen species and other stresses [6], [7]. The C. elegans genome encodes a single HIF alpha subunit, hif-1, and mutants lacking a functional hif-1 gene are viable in normal culture conditions [8], [9]. In this study, we report that over-expression of HIF-1 protein extends the lifespan of C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, we find that loss-of-function mutations in hif-1 gene can also increase C. elegans longevity and stress tolerance. The HIF-1 over-expression and hif-1 loss-of-function longevity phenotypes are not equivalent, as they differ in their dependence on daf-16/FOXO and skn-1/NRF2. These data provide insights to the intersection between oxygen homeostasis and aging, and they suggest that post-mitotic aging may be influenced by treatments or mutations that alter HIF-1 signaling.
