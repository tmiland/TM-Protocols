"Preset_Notes=Spooky2 ICU - released 20180221.

This preset is one of a set of three developed by Mark Davies which use different wavelengths of invisible light for different health purposes.

This one uses long wavelength ultraviolet (UV). Ultraviolet sits above the visible light spectrum. It's essential for the body to produce Vitamin D, and Vitamin D is essential for immune function and healthy skeletal structure. It's instructive to note that many internal organs have Vitamin D receptors.

The preset transmits a wavelength of 380nm over 30 minutes. This has been found to work very well for cell healing and repair.

During the development of this preset pack, it became apparent that the Wave Cycle Multiplication technology built into Spooky2 was not having the desired effect. Mark intended to use a high WCM value to bring the frequencies closer to the actual wavelength, but to his surprise, he found that a value of 5 actually seemed to be 'scattering' or dissipating the expected 'punch.' When he dropped the value to 1, that punch was present, and could be sensed physically.

It may be that this is due to the nature of mathematical physics itself. The multiplicative process, by its nature, will always amplify errors, whereas division will always have a reductionist effect which must culminate in greater accuracy.

Even though DNA itself communicates using photons of light, it has no difficulties transposing frequency up to wavelength, and doing it far more accurately than Spooky2 itself can.

Use as desired. But this preset should not be run non-stop.
